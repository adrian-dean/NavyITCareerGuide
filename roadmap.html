📌 Notes:
ITs who go to JCAC will qualify for high-level cyber NECs and may transition into CWT (Cyber Warfare Technician).

Security clearance (Secret or TS/SCI) is required for most NECs beyond 2794.

NECs can be earned via formal C-Schools, on-the-job qualification, or billet assignment.

Use the Navy COOL website to verify NECs and credentialing paths.

If you're looking to maximize career progression, target these areas:

Earn Security+, then move toward CISSP, CEH, or CCNA/CCNP.

Try for JCAC and cyber command billets.

Get certified as a 2791/2792/2793, then transition into cyber or leadership.

Qualify for instructor (805A) and MTS (9502) if you're ever at a shore command or schoolhouse.

do ITs have billet based advancements
ChatGPT said:
Yes, Navy Information Systems Technicians (ITs) can receive billet-based advancements, though it depends on the specific assignment, NEC, and command needs. This type of advancement is not common for all billets but does exist under certain structured programs.

🧭 What is Billet-Based Advancement?
Billet-Based Advancement (BBA) is a Navy initiative that allows sailors to advance in rank based on the critical nature of their billet rather than traditional time-in-rate or exam scores. The advancement is tied to the job, not just performance alone.

✅ Billet-Based Advancement for ITs
🔹 Common Programs Where ITs May Qualify
Cyber Mission Force (CMF) Billets

Located at: Fort Meade, NSA, or other cyber commands

ITs working in defensive/offensive cyber ops, especially if they hold cyber NECs like:

743A/B (Cyber Defense/Red Team)

741A (ISSM)

CWT (Cyber Warfare Technician — formerly CTN track)

JCAC graduates and those supporting CMF roles can be eligible for billet-based advancement via:

SEA (Selective Early Advancement)

Meritorious Promotion

Enlisted Advancement-to-Position (EAP) program

Instructor Duty (805A / 9502)

Highly rated instructors at “A” or “C” Schools or CIWT Detachments may be selected for EAP slots if the billet is mission-critical.

High-Need Operational Units

Afloat billets (e.g., CANES (H09A) aboard specific ships, EKMS Managers, or Tactical Comm billets like H03A) may become EAP-eligible depending on manning shortages.

Submarine platforms (ITS) and shore stations with elevated security clearance needs may also promote ITs tied to billet criticality.

📌 Important Notes
You must be in the billet (i.e., selected and executing duties) to receive billet-based advancement.

The billet must be designated EAP-eligible or within an advancement-incentivized community, usually coordinated by:

Your detailer

Community manager

Command Master Chief / CO

Documentation is routed through your chain of command, with endorsements and justification of performance and billet criticality.

🔍 How to Increase Your Chances
Step	Description
1. Secure high-demand NECs	Cyber (743A/741A), CANES (H09A), Tactical (H03A), or ISSM roles
2. Volunteer for critical billets	CMF teams, NSA/Fort Meade, overseas IA, or remote comms billets
3. Request via Detailer	Ask if BBA billets are open when negotiating PCS
4. Perform at the top level	Ranked EP, solid CO/CMC support required
5. Track policy updates	Follow NAVADMINs or talk to your CCC for the latest EAP announcements
📄 Resources
NAVADMIN 221/17 – Introduced EAP as a tool for billet-based promotion.

MyNavyHR – Posts current BBA opportunities and qualifying ratings.

Your Career Counselor – Can check if your billet has advancement potential.

If you want, I can help you find current billet-based advancement opportunities for ITs based on your command type or NEC—just let me know your current or projected duty station.

You said:
CWT is a Rate not necessarily a NEC, but could I take JCAC and maybe transfer to a CWT or even just stay as an IT after JCAC
ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right — Cyber Warfare Technician (CWT) is now recognized as a distinct rating, not just a NEC or pathway. That said, there are routes for Information Systems Technicians (ITs) to attend JCAC and either transfer into the CWT rating or stay as an IT with powerful cyber NECs and billet options.

Here’s how it breaks down:

🔐 Can ITs Attend JCAC?
Yes — but it’s competitive.

ITs can be selected to attend the Joint Cyber Analysis Course (JCAC), especially if they’re working in cyber billets or are targeted for cyber assignments.

Selection typically requires:

TS/SCI eligibility

Strong performance (EP evals help)

Command endorsement

High ASVAB/line scores (especially for reclassification)

Willingness to take cyber-specific roles after graduation

🔄 Two Pathways After JCAC
✅ 1. Lateral Conversion to CWT (From IT)
After completing JCAC, you can request a rating conversion to CWT.

This is best if you want to dedicate your career to offensive/defensive cyber in CMF or NSA-style units.

You’ll be designated a CWT1, CWT2, etc., and follow their advancement path, leadership pipeline, and community requirements.

✅ 2. Stay an IT with Cyber NECs
If you don't convert, you stay IT, but gain valuable cyber NECs like:

743A – JCAC Graduate

743B – Cyber Operations/Defense Technician

741A – Information Systems Security Manager

742A – Vulnerability Technician

This allows you to take cyber billets, CMF-support roles, or work with NCDOC, FCC, or even fleet red/blue teams — while retaining IT advancement/retirement benefits.

Also opens the door for billet-based advancement (EAP) as discussed earlier.

📌 Pros & Cons: Staying IT vs Converting to CWT
Stay as IT	Convert to CWT
NECs	743A/B, 741A, 742A	Not NEC-based; full CWT career
Advancement	IT path (E6-E9), possible EAP	Competitive CWT advancement path
Flexibility	More billets (shore, ship, cyber, etc.)	Focused on cyber mission only
Specialization	Cyber + Admin/Comms	100% cyber warfare focus
Shore Options	Training, admin, cyber, NCTAMS	CMF teams, NSA, CyberCom, JSOC
🛠️ How to Get to JCAC as an IT
TS/SCI eligible — initiate or ensure your clearance package is active.

Talk to your chain of command and cyber detailer — they’ll track selection cycles.

Submit JCAC package when cycles open (usually announced via NAVADMIN or directly from Cyber Forces).

Be open to cyber billets (NCDOC, NIOC, CMF, etc.)—these improve selection chances.

Excel at IT security work now—NECs like 2793 (IA Tech), 741A (ISSM) are strong signals.

💬 Final Thoughts
Yes, you can attend JCAC as an IT.

After JCAC, you have the power to choose: remain an IT with enhanced cyber capabilities or formally convert to the CWT rating.

Remaining IT gives you broader billet and advancement options, while CWT locks you into elite cyber warfare roles with deep specialization.

If you're interested, I can help you draft a JCAC application path, or a plan to build up the NECs and qualifications that make you a top-tier cyber candidate.

You said:
can ITs take CTT, CTR, and CTM schools?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — and the answer is nuanced. ITs generally cannot take CTT, CTR, or CTM schools as part of their standard career path, because those schools are designed specifically for Cryptologic Technicians (CTs) in their respective branches. However, there are some exceptions and workarounds in special cases.

🔍 CT Rates Overview (Quick Context)
CT Rating	Full Name	Mission
CTT	Cryptologic Technician Technical	Electronic Warfare (EW), radar/signals analysis
CTR	Cryptologic Technician Collection	Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), direction-finding
CTM	Cryptologic Technician Maintenance	Maintains cryptologic and SIGINT equipment
⚠️ Standard Rule: No, ITs can’t directly take CT schools
Each CT branch has its own A- and C-schools restricted to those in the rating (CTT, CTR, CTM, CTI, or CWO selection). ITs can’t just “sign up” for those schools because:

They're rate-specific.

They require different NECs and ASVAB line scores.

Clearance and platform access are tightly controlled (often SCI/TS-SCI with polygraph).

✅ Exceptions / Special Cases Where ITs Intersect with CT Schools
1. Cross-Rate (Lateral Conversion)
If you're an IT and want to become a CT (especially CTM or CTR), you can apply for conversion.
Requirements:

Meet ASVAB/line score thresholds

Have the required clearance level

Be approved by the community manager

Often need to attend the CT A-school, followed by specialized C-schools

Once accepted:

You become a CT, lose IT designation

Then you attend CTT/CTM/CTR schools as part of the rating pipeline

2. Cyber Mission Force (CMF) / JCAC
If you get selected for JCAC or work in CMF billets, you may:

Train alongside CTNs or CTRs

Get similar instruction (e.g., in SIGINT, cyber tools, network defense)

Possibly attend shared joint-service courses that mirror CT pipeline content
Still, you remain an IT unless you cross-rate.

3. Joint Assignments / NEC Crossover
If you serve at commands like:

NIOC (Navy Information Operations Command)

NSA

CYBERCOM

...you might receive training that overlaps with CTR or CTM schools, but it’s rarely the exact course and doesn’t grant the CT NECs unless you convert.

✳️ Summary: IT Access to CT Schools
School	Can ITs Attend?	How?
CTT A/C School	❌ No	Must lateral convert to CTT
CTR A/C School	❌ No	Must lateral convert to CTR
CTM A/C School	❌ No	Must lateral convert to CTM
CTN/JCAC-related schools	✅ Yes	Through cyber billet or selection
Shared inter-service training (CMF)	✅ Some	Joint assignments or cyber ops NECs
🧠 Bonus Tip:
If you're interested in SIGINT, offensive cyber, or EW, but want to stay IT, your best bet is:

JCAC (get 743A)

Cyber billets (CMF, Red/Blue Team)

743B/742A/741A NECs
These give you CT-adjacent capabilities without losing your rating.

Let me know if you want a conversion package plan for CTM or CTR, or the most direct path to IT-cyber crossover via JCAC or NECs.

Create a website that is usable in github consisting all of this information.

these are the pages I want:
home, programs, training, education
you can add any other pages that would be considered great
ChatGPT said:
The homepage structure for your Navy IT career website is ready. It includes navigation for the main sections: Home, Programs, Training, Education, Career Roadmap, and Resources. Next, I’ll create the other pages (like programs.html, training.html, etc.) with the detailed content we discussed.

Would you like a consistent design layout (with navigation/footer) across all pages, and should we use pure HTML/CSS, or add JavaScript for interactivity?

You said:
HTML, CSS, and Javascript sounds great

maybe even typescript or tailwind. 

i primarily want to copy the code you give me and paste into github
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
The homepage now uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes a linked script.js file for JavaScript functionality. It's optimized for GitHub Pages—you can copy the code directly into your GitHub repo.

Next, I’ll build the individual pages (programs.html, training.html, etc.). Want me to generate a full GitHub folder structure too (HTML pages, JS, Tailwind setup, etc.)?

You said:
yes give everything
ChatGPT said:
Here's your complete GitHub-ready project folder structure. I'll now populate each HTML page with Tailwind styling, create a working JavaScript template, and include a sample README.md. Want the Tailwind setup to use a CDN (simple) or the full CLI with PostCSS (customizable build)?

You said:
which is better?
ChatGPT said:
Great question. Here’s a clear comparison to help you decide which Tailwind setup is better for your use case:

⚡ CDN Version (Recommended for You)
✅ Pros:
Super simple — just link it in <head> using one line.

Works instantly on GitHub Pages with no build tools.

Perfect for smaller projects or portfolios like your IT guide.

No setup or Node.js required.

❌ Cons:
Can’t purge unused classes (slightly larger file size).

Limited customization (no custom themes/plugins).

🛠️ Tailwind CLI / PostCSS Build
✅ Pros:
Full control — configure colors, spacing, dark mode, etc.

Smaller file size with purge/tree-shaking.

Can add plugins like typography, forms, or custom variants.

❌ Cons:
Requires Node.js, npm, and a build pipeline (PostCSS, etc.).

More complex deployment for GitHub Pages (needs CI/CD or build before push).

Overkill for a mostly static info site.

✅ Verdict:
Since you said you want to copy code and paste it into GitHub, the CDN version is the better option. It’s easy, works out of the box with GitHub Pages, and still looks modern and clean using Tailwind.

I'll continue building your site using Tailwind via CDN, with HTML + optional JS. Next: I’ll generate programs.html. Want me to auto-link all pages to each other in the nav bar as I go?

You said:
yes and use CDN
ChatGPT said:
The programs.html page is now complete, styled with Tailwind via CDN, and includes links to all other pages. Next, I’ll build training.html with NECs, C-schools, and billet-based advancement info. Want that broken down by category (core, cyber, afloat, etc.)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
The training.html page is complete, with NECs grouped into Core, Cyber, Afloat/Tactical, and Instructor categories, plus a section on billet-based advancement.

Next up: education.html, which will cover Navy eLearning, JKO, TWMS, JST credit strategies, and recommended civilian platforms (Coursera, edX, Udemy, etc.). Ready for me to proceed?

You said:
yes, include IT/Cyber degrees from a wide variety of universities including WGU
ChatGPT said:
The education.html page is now complete, with sections on Navy training platforms, civilian learning sites, college degree programs (including WGU), and JST credit tips.

Next, I’ll generate roadmap.html to visually walk through an IT career path from E1 to E9. Would you like a clean vertical progression, or a multi-path layout showing options for Cyber, Instructor, and Leadership tracks side-by-side?

You said:
could you show me both
ChatGPT said:
The roadmap.html page now includes both:

A vertical progression (E1 to E9)

A side-by-side layout of Cyber, Instructor, and IT Specialist career tracks

Up next: resources.html, which will include links to tools like Navy COOL, MyNavyHR, JST, Navy eLearning, and NEOCS/NAVADMIN references. Ready for that?

You said:
sure
ChatGPT said:
The resources.html page is complete with links to Navy COOL, MNP, JST, JKO, TWMS, and more—everything a Navy IT needs for career navigation and training access.

Would you like me to now generate:

script.js (starter functionality),

README.md (GitHub overview + deploy instructions), and

style.css (optional tweaks on top of Tailwind)?

Let me know which you'd like to include.

You said:
yes to all of the above
ChatGPT said:
✅ You're all set!

Your project now includes:

Fully styled HTML pages (6 total)

JavaScript for dynamic nav highlighting

Optional CSS for custom tweaks

A clean, deployable README for GitHub Pages

Would you like a .zip folder of everything combined, or instructions to create it locally from GitHub?

You said:
please
ChatGPT said:
Your full Navy IT career website is ready to download and deploy:

🔗 Click here to download the ZIP file

Once downloaded, you can extract it and upload it to your GitHub repository. Then follow the instructions in the README.md to publish it using GitHub Pages.

Want help making a GitHub repo or uploading it? 

You said:
how would you do that?
